# Repositories and archives

## Summary

Intro: all repositories you can use along the way of your research 
<!-- Tools to store and share research outcomes from various stages of the cycle? 
Find & compare disciplinary repositories through Repository of Research Data Repositories https://www.re3data.org/

## Motivation

Data should be submitted to domain or discipline specific, community recognised repository where possible, or to a general purpose or multidisciplinary repository if no suitable discipline specific repository is available. Discipline specific data repositories are likely to have more functionalities for the type of data that you would like to share, as well as community standards that you can adhere to to make the data more FAIR (link to FAIR principles). Why sharing data is a good idea is covered in other places in these guides, e.g. [Motivations for sharing and archiving data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-sharing.html?highlight=repository#motivations-for-sharing-data) and [Open data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-data.html#open-data).

The choice of repository can depend on multiple factors:

- Your discipline
- Type of digital output
- File size
- Policies/requirements from institutions, national policies, funding agencies
- Access restrictions


The following questions may help you to identify a suitable Data Repository:

- Is there a disciplinary-specific community recognised data repository I can submit my data to, thereby helping to preserve my data according to recognised standards in my discipline?
- Is the data repository known by the research community?
- Are other's using the data repository to share their data? Is it listed in Re3data / FAIRsharing?
- Has a data repository been specified by my funder/publisher/institution?
- What are the file size requirements and limitations?
- What are the costs for data sharing?
- What data formats are allowed? Will it take the data that you want to share?
- Does it provide a persistent identifier, for example a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)?
- Does it provide the right type of access control that suits the sharing conditions of the data? (restricted access/embargo's)
- Is there support available on how to curate the data/metadata?


After making the decision to share data, or other research outputs, another decision needs to be made: *where* to share those research outputs. This chapter outlines some od the crucial functionalities that you should look out for when picking where to share your data, code, slides, or any other research output.
