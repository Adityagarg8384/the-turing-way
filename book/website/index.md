# Welcome

_Welcome to The Turing Way Handbook: Your Path to Reproducible, Ethical, and Collaborative Data Science._

_The Turing Way_ is more than a book; it's a global collaboration and a supportive community where collaboration is key. 
Rooted in open source, global collaboration, and community strength, _The Turing Way_ shapes a future where data science is accessible, comprehensible, and beneficial for all.

## Join _The Turing Way_

Our mission is to equip researchers and data scientists across diverse sectors, including academia, industry, government, and the public, with the information and best practices they need at all stages of their work.

We strive to foster a shared understanding of everyone's responsibility for reproducibility in data science, ensuring that the projects thet work on are responsible, reproducible, and easy to reuse.

### Calling Everyone In: Your Participation and Perspectives Matter!

The Turing Way community is a open and collaborative space. 
It is an ecosystem where researchers, coders, leaders, and curious minds come together to make research "too easy not to do." 
We invest in socio-technical skills, fostering a team spirit to build something greater than any individual effort.

### Community Opportunities

* **Collaboration Beyond Boundaries**: Engage in a global collaboration that transcends borders and welcomes diverse perspectives.
* **Skill Development**: Learn a skills, share a skill that you have and contribute to projects in making a real impact.
* **Learn, Remix, Reuse**: Dive into our resources, and feel free to remix and reuse materials (just remember to attribute as per our [License](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md)].

### How to Get Involved

* Explore our [GitHub resources](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way) and contribute to ongoing projects following our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Join our vibrant community on [our Slack workspace](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack) to connect with like-minded individuals and share your ideas or questions.
* Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a positive and inclusive experience for everyone.

Your journey with _The Turing Way_ is not just about contribution; it's about collaboration, learning, and making an impact. 
More information about the community and the project is available in the {ref}`ch`.

We are committed to creating a space where more people with diverse expertise and lived experiences can share their knowledge with others to allow us all to use data science to make a positive impact on the world.

```{admonition} Translation
:class: tip
Call for translators! We’re looking for contributors to help translate this space for everyone! Read more about our translation workflow and how you can contribute to it in the {ref}`translation chapter<ch-translation>`.
```
We hope you find the book helpful and join us in co-creating and maintaining _The Turing Way_.

We welcome you to our community!

(welcome-history)=
## History

The story of _The Turing Way_ began in January 2019 as a guide for reproducibility, focusing on essential technical skills like {ref}`rr-vcs`, {ref}`rr-testing` and {ref}`rr-ci`. However, technical proficiency was just one piece of the puzzle in making data science research "open for all."
In February 2020, The Turing Way embarked on an exciting evolution, expanding into a comprehensive series of guides, covering {ref}`reproducibility<rr>`, {ref}`project design<pd>`, {ref}`collaboration<cl>`, {ref}`communication<cm>` and {ref}`research ethics<er>`.

This transformation wasn't just about adding more content; it was about embracing a holistic approach to empower a diverse community of contributors. 
_The Turing Way_ is a perpetual 'work in progress,' shaped by the collective efforts of international contributors from research institutes, universities, government departments, and industry internationally.

Each chapter is a result of large collaboration, attributed to _The Turing Way_ community, where every contributor is a co-author. 
Explore about our contributors in {ref}`contributors-record`.
Join them as we continue to shape the future of open science and make data science accessible to all!

### Funding

Since 2019, _The Turing Way_ has been supported and funded by [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).
In 2023, the project secured additional funding from the [InnovateUK BridgeAI](https://iuk.ktn-uk.org/programme/bridgeai/) to establish [_The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub), expanding its impact through strategic collaborations with different organisations in their efforts to promote adoption of AI and open science.

## Citing _The Turing Way_

All material in _The Turing Way_ is available under a [CC-BY 4.0 licence](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/the-turing-way/) and [Zenodo community page](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way).
Each resource can be individually cited.

The book should be cited as described for the project's Zenodo archive using DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3233853](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853).

The citation should look something like:

> _The Turing Way_ Community. (2022). _The Turing Way_: A handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research. Zenodo. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3233853. 

Please visit the [DOI link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853) though to get the most recent version - the one above is not automatically generated and may be out of date.
DOIs allow us to archive the repository and are useful for tracking the work in academic publications.

You can also share the human-readable URL to a page in the book, for example, {ref}`https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions.html <rr-overview-definitions>`, but be aware that the project is under development and these links may change over time.
You might want to include a [web archive link](http://web.archive.org), such as: [https://web.archive.org/web/20191030093753/https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/reproducibility/03/definitions.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030093753/https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/reproducibility/03/definitions.html), to make sure that you do not end up with broken links everywhere!

We really appreciate any references that you make to _The Turing Way_ project in your work, and we hope it is useful.
If you have any questions, please [get in touch](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way#get-in-touch).
