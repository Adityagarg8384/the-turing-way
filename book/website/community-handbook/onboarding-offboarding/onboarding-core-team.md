# ☀️ Welcome to *The Turing Way* Core Team!☀️

:::success
This onboarding document is a living document – as is *The Turing Way* itself. As you'll learn from being in this community: this is a constantly-evolving project that holds [emergence as a core value](https://hackmd.io/kVkwKSYuSLWWhLzlNSuT0g). In other words: as the project evolves – so will the team that enables its sustainability as a project.

From April to August 2022, Anne (TTW CM, 2022) documented [documented her research of/within *The Turing Way* community on Github](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/discussions/2552). Much of that research has been used to make this onboarding document.
