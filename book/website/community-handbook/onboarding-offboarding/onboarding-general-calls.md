# General Onboarding Calls

**Welcome to The Turing Way!**

We're so glad to have you here!

Our goal is to provide individuals and organizations in academia, industry, government, and the public sectors the information they need to ensure that their projects are easy to reproduce and reuse. 

We encourage all stakeholders in data science to utilise _The Turing Way_ to understand their roles and responsibilities for reproducibility.

This onboarding document is a living document – as is *The Turing Way* itself. As you'll learn from being in this community: this is a constantly-evolving project that holds [emergence as a core value](https://hackmd.io/kVkwKSYuSLWWhLzlNSuT0g). In other words: as the project evolves – so will the team that enables its sustainability as a project.

## About the Onboarding Call

Historically, onboarding in _The Turing Way_ community has happened through 1:1 connections, between the Community Manager or Community Leaders and prospective community members of the project. As the project has grown, so have the number of entry points: where folks may be interacting with different parts of project and community in .

Starting in 2024, these calls are hosted every two months, where community leaders meet new members and create a space for them to connect with our community and available resources, ensuring they have the support they need to navigate and kickstart their journey with _The Turing Way_. These calls create an open space for questions, discussions, and a warm welcome into our community.

During this hour-long call, participants learn about _The Turing Way_ project in a group setting and how to contribute to different sub-projects and working groups within the community, and may gain hands-on experience in contributing to _The Turing Way_ guides (in some cases, even making their first pull request!). 

This is a space to bring your questions and interests – we're so excited to meet you!  

## Agenda

As of January 2024, onboarding calls are being trialed using the following format:

1. Introduction, icebreaker
2. The Turing Way - What is it?
3. How to get involved with The Turing Way? 
4. Do you have any questions for us? 
5. Feedback 

## Want to onboard other community members? 

Please join the [#onboarding](https://theturingway.slack.com/archives/C06EVT7GKK3) channel on _The Turing Way_ slack! 

We would love to have more community members join in welcoming others to the community.
