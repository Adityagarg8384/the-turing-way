# Core Team Offboarding Checklist

ðŸŒ™ **We are sad to see you leave *The Turing Way* Core Team!** ðŸŒ™

Whether it's changed responsibilities, a new job, shifting interests, or any other reason â€“â€“Â we understand that life happens, and that communities will always be shifting and evolving! While we are sad to see you go for now, we hope that you'll stay engaged with us in *The Turing Way* community! 

This offboarding document is a living document â€“ as is *The Turing Way* itself. As you'll learn from being in this community: this is a constantly-evolving project that holds [emergence as a core value](https://hackmd.io/kVkwKSYuSLWWhLzlNSuT0g). 

In other words: as the project evolves â€“Â so will the team that enables its sustainability as a project.

## Documenting your Experiences

We understand that wrapping up your projects, chapters, and  X_The Turing Way_, 

We ask that you please update your [Record of Contributions](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html) to document your experiences with contributing to _The Turing Way_.

We would also love to capture your institutional knowledge. The Research Community Manager or Research Project Manager will schedule an offboarding call with you in order to help document your experiences with The Turing Way.

## Celebrating your Contributions

Thank you so much for all your contributions to *The Turing Way*. We really appreciate you sharing your time and expertise with us in this community!

The Research Community Manager or Research Project Manager will reach out to discuss how to celebrate you in a way you prefer.

(Developing 'emeritus' community member programme? Any way of accounting for this?)
