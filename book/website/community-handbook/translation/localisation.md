## Localisation Platforms and Translation

Localisation involves more than just translation, which only transforms text. Localisation addresses other factors such as text length and cultural references.  **A Translation Management System (TMS)** manages the localisation process from the beginning of a translation process until the finished product. They are widely used in Open source projects because they offer many advantages such as workflow,  automation, transparency, and fast project delivery.

### Features of localisation Platforms:

- **Translation Memory**

Translation Memory can be described as a database of sentences or texts and their translations that can be automatically reused in/outside the project. Translation Memory can be very powerful in ensuring consistent and high-quality translations across different projects.
- **Glossary**

A glossary is a collection of the key terms that are used in the project to ensure consistency. The glossary helps in creating, storing, and managing all the project terminology in one place.
- **Machine Translation**

Machine Translation can speed up the translation process. It provides translation suggestions from automatic translation services like Google Translate and AutoML Translation, Microsoft Translate, and more. 
- **Integration with GitHub**

Continues integration is vital for automation in open sources projects. Many localisation platforms offer integration with GitHub, which synchronises source and translation files between your GitHub repository and translation project.
- **Screenshots for the context**

Screenshots provide context to the text for translation. TMS offers the opportunity of attaching screenshots to each of the phrases can provide a visual context to translators
- **QA checks**

Many TMS support QA checks. These can include Spelling and/or grammatical errors, inconsistent placeholders and unbalanced brackets. These QA checks make the translation process smoother for translators.
