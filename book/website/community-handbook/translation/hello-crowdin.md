The Middle-top area (3) is the main working area with the source string on the top, and the section where you can type in translations below.

The context to the string is shown right below the source string. Typically it can include descriptions and screenshots. You can request context from here if necessary.

The terms that were added to the project glossary will be underlined in the source string. You can check additional explanation added to the term for the accurate translation. A project manager can also give you permission to add terms to the project glossary.
