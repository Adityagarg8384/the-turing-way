## Getting Started in Translating _The Turing Way_

Our current Translation Management System is Crowdin. Crowdin is integrated to a GitHub fork of The Turing Way in a temporary GitHub Organization. Every time the repository is updated, Crowdin starts an automatic translation. These translations need to be reviewed and accepted before being considered final.

### Join the Translation Team in Crowdin

- Create an account in Crowdin through [this link](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register?domain=turingway&continue=%2Fturing-way)

- Review the Translation Guidelines.
  - What should *not* be translated for consistency and structural integrity.
  - It is essential to harmonise and standardise translations. Make sure you read them before you start translating for the first time.
  - Each language has the Translation Priorities list, which you can find it in the README file. Choose one one of the high priorities files.

- Choose the language you want to contribute to it. We have currently 4 languages with active contributors, which are Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese and Chinese.   

```{admonition} Add New Language
:class: tip
If your language isn't in the list, please feel free to contact one of the managers and ask for new language through Crowdin or Slack.
