## Workflow for translation within TTW

By translation workflow, we do not refer only to the phases that contributors should follow during the translation process. Instead, we refer to a set of key and optional aspects which can lead to a succesful and sustainable translation project. The translation process can be grouped into four distinct stages. Let's jump in each of them!

1. Before translation
2. Starting a new language translation
3. During translation
4. After translation

### Before translation

Building a new translation project is an exciting way to contribute towards a global _The Turing Way_. Before starting a translation project, it remains relevant to reflect upon the following questions:
- Which are your expectations with a translated content? 
- What are the expectations of the target audience?
- Do you see the target language in the localisator platform?
    - Check out within the existing languages being translated. 
    - Reach out existing translation teams and ask them good practices.

### Starting a new language translation 

When starting a new language translation, there are several aspects to consider apart from [setting up a project in the choosen localisator plaform]().

#### Define norms of translation

It is key to set translation norms. These norms will guide new comers how to translate and review in the translation platform. For instance,  we strongly suggest to set a [glosary] through the localisator platform. 

#### Create a dedicated slack channel

We recommend you to create a dedicated slack channel for the language you are translating within the [_The Turing Way_ slack](theturingway.slack.com). This space will allow you to bring chat with interested parties in your own language. 

#### Organise co-working calls

We suggest to define co-working calls to progress on the translation. These sessions should be open to anyone interested in participating.

You can also work on the translation in the co-working calls of The Turing Way project. You can find this activity in [_The Turing Way_ calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dGhldHVyaW5nd2F5QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ). Please note that these calls are in English.

#### Asynchronous translation:

Everyone interested in participating in a translation effort should be able to work asynchronously, have this in mind when writing the translation norms and any other documentation for your language.

### During translation

#### Before you start translating: 
Localisator platforms integrate different tools and formats for assisting the translation process. For instance, [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) includes the targt text blocks to be translated on the left and a translation box on the right. You can select with the cursor which block to translate. 

We recommend that you look at a translated chapter or section before you start translating to familiarise yourself with the process and the translation style.

#### Machine translation / Translation tools

The translation process can be assisted by machine translation. Localisator platforms such as Crowdin are  integrated with well-known machine translation providers including Google, Microsoft, etc. In contrast, for Transifex, this process is performed outside the platform. In this particular case, we recommend using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) as a translation tool. DeepL tool recommends a series of synonyms when you click in the translated text. These can be useful especially with long texts. 

#### Read the translation rules

These rules are essential to harmonise and standardise translations. Make sure you read them before you start translating for the first time.

#### Priority list of chapters to translate
In each co-working or external session, prioritise those chapters that are outdated or close to completion.


### After translation

As the Turing Way content grows, the translated content does too. In this regard, we strongly encourage to monitor the TTW content. While updates of the translated content might change according to the availability of resources, it is a good practice to:
* Have periodical reviewings. 
* Improve the translation
* Update glossaries
