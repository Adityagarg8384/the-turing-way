## Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration

(cl-academic-industry-establish-initial)=

### Initial Collaboration 

There is no standard route to setting up an academic-industry collaboration. 
These collaborations may spring from small organic interactions such as researchers connecting at a conference, or may be driven more 'formally' by a partnerships team at either organisation. 

Before jumping into a formal partnership, it may be useful to first collaborate on a smaller project or task of shared interest. 
This allows both organisations to see how the other works, how you collaborate together and overall 'test the waters'. 

In the case of the Turing-Roche partnership, the two organisations initially collaborated through a weeklong [Turing Data Study Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/data-study-group-final-report-roche) CITATION NUMBER 1. 
At these collaborative hackathons a challenger owner, in this case Roche, provide a dataset and a real-world problem to be solved by a team of researchers from the Turing network. 
For Roche, the Data Study Group highlighted the research capabilities of the Turing Institute as well as importantly developing the relationship between Turing and Roche. 
This allowed both parties to see that they could productively work together, and spurred on scoping out what became a five-year formal partnership, launched in June 2021.

### Collaboration Set-up

A new academic-industry collaboration will require developing and scoping a scientific/research strategy. 
Alongside this, negotiating formal documents will require much discussion, such as legal contracts that consider intellectual property and data sharing. 
For more detail on developing a contract, governance and more, we recommend this comprehensive ['Academia-Industry Collaboration Best Practices Guide'](https://eatris.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CORBEL_Academia_Industry_Collaboration_Best_Practices_Guide.pdf) CITATION NUMBER 2 from the Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Enduring Life-science Services [(CORBEL) Project](https://www.corbel-project.eu/home.html). 

In the case of the Turing-Roche partnership, both the Turing Institute and Roche had a mutual commitment to open science principles which helped shape negotiations and set relatively flexible and collaborative terms around intellectual property. 
The basis of the partnership was also to develop methodologies, rather than developing products or a collaboration on drug discovery, which would likely complicate contracting.

For scoping a scientific strategy, the partnership approach was to brainstorm potential research topics from both parties to identify areas of common interest. 
From this a North Star was developed to guide the direction of future research as well as a set of principles such as collaboration and open science which the partnership would operate under. 
Based upon these the partnership settled on research areas that fitted the priorities of both organisations. 
It is important to review this scientific strategy on a regular basis and adapt as necessary in response to ongoing research.

### Governance

With any collaboration, its important to plan how you're going to work together. 
A useful initial exercise can be collaboratively drafting a team charter. 
This document allows you to map out team structure, who is involved from each organisation and their roles and responsibilities within the collaboration. 
The activity of creating the charter can also allow you to align expectations and reflect on any cultural differences and ways of working. 

In the Turing-Roche partnership, the [team charter](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/blob/main/partnership-team-charter.md) also formed the basis of their governance model. 
They developed an initial set of meetings which structured decision making processes for the partnership and running day to day activities:

* **Joint Steering Committee**: Occurs twice a year and brings together all senior partnership members to review partnership strategic direction and to make any high level decisions
* **Core Meetings**: Occur monthly and brings together senior partnership members to discuss strategic activities and get high level updates
* **Operational Meetings**: Occur fortnightly and bring together deputy scientific leads and operational team to ensure delivery of partnership activities

They have since developed other meetings as needed, such as ad hoc strategy meetings to brainstorm new activities, ensuring they are on track for the partnership aims and to consider future opportunities and the legacy of the partnership; lab meetings to bring together the team and all researchers working on the scientific aims of the partnership and facilitate connections; and catch-ups between postdoctoral researchers for sharing preliminary work.

Alongside these meetings, they also try to ensure parity in our partnership activities, for example ensuring equal representation of Turing and Roche colleagues on interview and funding call panels. 
Any new substantial project as part of the partnership is also drawn up as a project agreement document for signing on both sides, ensuring expectations are set out clearly and there is alignment.  

For the Turing-Roche partnership (and indeed most collaborations) project management is essential and the partnership hired a full time project manager for the partnership based at the Turing Institute. 
Their wide ranging role (from contracting, creating meeting agendas, budgeting, scoping new partnership activities and more) ultimately ensures smooth running of the partnership and that governance is implemented. 
There is also a project manager colleague engaged on the Roche side which works well for ensuring consistency. 

Additional resources that may also be of use in these planning stages are the {ref}`Turing Way Project Design Guide <pd-overview>` and the {ref}`Ethical Consideratons when Choosing an Open Source Governance Model chapter <er-ethics-open-source-governance>`.
