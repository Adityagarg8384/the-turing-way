# Research Ethics for Social Data

(er-social-data-overview)=
## Social Data: Overview

Social data is defined as the publicly available information which is collected from users’ public online activity on social media networks, consisting of information such as their location, language, and content shared. 
Examples of such data would include images, text, location, biographical data, as well as shared and reposted links.
Information created by the platform users could also form a part of such data, such as blogtagging, online game playing, photo tagging and instant messenger.

## Why do we need ethical considerations while working with social data?

Collecting social data for various academic and non-academic research purposes have become quite common in recent years, especially useful in understanding trends or patterns from the collective online activities of the users. 
This not only helps researchers in understanding the online discourse and the public sentiment, but also gives an opportunity to analyse the vast amount of data reserves. 
Essentially it has been used to develop applications facilitating marketing to enriching physical and digital security.
But with a large amount of data, comes great responsibility.
While there are initial checks performed by the gatekeepers of these social platforms in deciding who gets access to the data, the onus of responsibly using the available data lies upon the researcher and/or the organization themselves.

### Social Data
We refer here to social data broadly as personal data, it refers to people or groups of people, but distinguish from it in two main ways.
First it remains social regardless of anonymization, whereas the term personal data refers exclusively to identifiable data in legal settings, second we use it here heavily associated with that which is generated via digital activity.

Digital activity or interactions can encompass data available in social media but it increasingly permeates to all kinds of activity as our world is heavily mediated by digital technologies, as a result it also refers to the whole labour of app workers, to our shopping patterns or our work applications.

#### What constitutes as social media platforms?

As stated by [Flashpoint](https://flashpoint.io/blog/social-data-enhanced-security/), for most, social media means a collection of popular websites and apps used to facilitate social interaction online—sites including:

* Social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn
* Photo and video-sharing networks like Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest
* Interactive media networks like Snapchat and TikTok
* Microblogging sites like Twitter and Tumblr

### We cannot be reduced to measurable attributes, to a database of intentions
### Raw data is an oxymoron:
what we measure is conditioned by the affordances of the technical systems and the decisions made on how to gather and quantify events and interactions that are qualitative in nature.
We group, make percentiles, indices, ranges etc. 
And all of that is decided by a small, not very diverse set of people who regardless of intentions possess specific worldviews or simply lack knowledge and awareness of other ways of being.

### The limitations of fairness
often times we try to fix the above by understanding the dataset better, dealing with missing data, changin the analysis, withdrawing sensitive or protected variables… this is know as a Bad Actor approach, and while all are steps to mitigate bias we need to acknowledge that it may be impossible to fully debias any dataset, model or analysis.

### Two unsurpassable barriers: 
#### models cannot be as complex as the systems they emulate
or they would be as complex as them, for people and society especially as we do not even know what we do not know and because they change constantly not being bound by stable norms. 
### Secondly there is an ontological barrier
between quantitative data science and qualitative aspects of life, the causal relationships between variables make it impossible, even more when we do not fully understand them. 
The latter can be exemplified in two good articles: first on the limits of algorithmic fairness, second by the one on causal graphs.

### Is it a lost cause: no. 
But we do need to be very clear on the limitations, because of these challenges the best mititagion is openness.
Being open about who made it, what data, what definition of fairness is used, what analysis is applied and very very especially what limitations remains. 
Accompanying any data science study, algorithm or tool of clear accompanying information on its limitations allows humans to better incorporate them into their decision making.

### How can we trust social data science then? 
We already do, but because these challenges and limitations are not communicated they emanate a false impression of robustness, accuracy and objectivity (and the latter may be the worst), this results in automated decision about people with life changing consequences.
Sometime that automation does not happen within a technical system or is the direct ouput of research, who can they say they do not make such decisions; the ethical risk lies in that through this aura of infallibility humans do automatically act.

### Open about everything? Can we just share all our data?
This guide already has some chapters dedicated to this challenge, despite a will to be open there are yet another set of ethical challenges associated with deciding what to share. 
We will not repeat here what already being said THERE and HERE but will go deeper in some specific social media data.
Where consent is possible and feasible, it should be sought from data subjects. Anynomization should also be considered when possible and meaningful.
Yet social media data and scrapped data often make both impossible (or turn anonymization useless and a mere instutional safeguard)
What to consider then? While we work on further guidance, here are some thoughts from smart people:
